DecodeVector ($N 13^{\circ} 6' 16.2''$, $E 77^{\circ} 34' 21.359''$) is a cohort of curious minds that is mathematical and abstract in spirit, deriving its motivation from practical and everyday computation.
Our aim is to understand the nature of computation and, as a consequence of this understanding, design more efficient algorithms. We engage in mathematics, logic, science and other formal concepts as long as the motivation is clearly drawn from the field of computing.

We largely focus on theoretical computer science, or TCS, which is a subset of general computer science and mathematics that focuses on more mathematical topics of computing and includes the theory of computation. It is difficult to circumscribe the theoretical areas precisely.
