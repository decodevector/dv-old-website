## Hello, World!
Welcome to DecodeVector! We are a group of people interested in theoretical computer science to be able to think and/or code for the future. DecodeVector is a place to learn and solve problems from this domain.

Theoretical Computer Science is mathematical and abstract in spirit, but it derives its motivation from practical and everyday computation. Its aim is to understand the nature of computation and, as a consequence of this understanding, provide more efficient methodologies. All studies related to mathematical, logic and formal concepts and methods could be considered as theoretical computer science, provided that the motivation is clearly drawn from the field of computing.
