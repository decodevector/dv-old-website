We're always looking for more members to join us - to help beginners to introduce to the field of computation and expand their analytical capabilities to design better algorithms, and eventually build a community of thinkers and solvers who can fluently look through this lens of computation.

If this happens to be the first page you're reading on this website, you may consider reading [about DV](/about/) before going further.

To be able to help you with starting TCS, it is essential that you come with the following <span title="What I tell you three times is true. - Lewis Caroll, The Hunting of the Snark.">prerequisites</span>. Apart from these, you're expected to have inclination for Mathematics and self-motivated to put in efforts at DV.
