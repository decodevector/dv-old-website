Given that an object is launched at an initial velocity $v$ with an angle from the horizontal in vacuum system placed on Earth. Gravity is experienced only downwards and may be represented by $a_g$. Derive the following kinematic quantities of a standard projectile motion.

$a$, Acceleration at any time $t$\\
$v$, Velocity at any time $t$\\
$x$ and $y$, Displacement at any time $t$\\
$T$, Total time of flight\\
$h$, Maximum height of the projectile\\
$d$, Maximum distance of the projectile
