_The following problem is taken from Project Euler._

Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:

```
[21] 22  23  24 [25]
 20 [07] 08 [09] 10
 19  06 [01] 02  11
 18 [05] 04 [03] 12
[17] 16  15  14 [13]
```
It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.

What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?
