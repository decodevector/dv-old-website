_The following problem is taken from Project Euler._

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with $1$ and $2$, the first 10 terms will be:

$$ 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ... $$

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
