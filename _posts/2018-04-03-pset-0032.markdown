Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent values and weights associated with n items respectively. Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).

Maximize $ \sum_{i=0}^{n}{v_i x_i}$

provided  $ \sum_{i=0}^{n}{w_i x_i} \le 0 $ and $x \in {0,1}$
