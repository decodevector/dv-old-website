Your rating can be calculated by

$$ 5 + 2S - \frac{T}{L+1} + P $$

where,

$S$ is the number of days you've solved at least one PSET problem,

$T$ is the total number of days since your date of join,

$L$ is your current level,

$P$ is the sum of points accumulated by solving PSET problems.

_Note_
* This rating is in effect from 2nd April, 2018.
* The rating begins from 5.
* Mark your progress [here](https://github.com/mathscapes/DecodeVector/wiki/Rating). Your rating will be calculated from here.

_New Rules for repeating members_
* Member who reaches a negative rating will be eliminated from DV group and must re-appear for the screening at least 2 weeks from their date of elimination. The screening will have a higher level of difficulty since they could not keep with the expected pace.
* There will be a -5 for everyone who will get back in the DV to nullify the bonus of 5 points that other members get.
* Such member must also retain the same GitHub repository and all their previous committed solutions will be counted in for new Day 1.
* Such member will still have a better problem solved per total days ratio but their name will be suffixed with a star mark to discourage behavior that led them to not to keep up with expected pace.
