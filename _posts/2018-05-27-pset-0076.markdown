Draw 1-bit half subtractor using minimum number of logic gates.
The half-subtractor is a combinational circuit which is used to perform subtraction of two bits. It has two inputs, X (minuend) and Y (subtrahend) and two outputs D (difference) and B (borrow).

| X | Y | D | B |
| - | - | - | - |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |

Now, write a python function to implement half adder only by using logic operators `and`,`or` and `not` arithmetic operators. Program takes two input X,Y and output D and B.
