_The following problem is taken from Project Euler._

Let $d(n)$ be defined as the sum of proper divisors of $n$ (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).

If $d(a) = b$ and $d(b) = a$, where $a \neq b$, then $a$ and $b$ are an amicable pair and each of $a$ and $b$ are called amicable numbers.

For example, the proper divisors of $220$ are $1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55$ and $110$; therefore $d(220) = 284$. The proper divisors of $284$ are $1, 2, 4, 71$ and $142$; so $d(284) = 220$.

Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under $10000$.
