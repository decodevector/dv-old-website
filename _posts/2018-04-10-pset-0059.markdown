Write a computer program which computes if this dumb monkey can climb on a pillar or not. Every time this monkey climbs, it goes up 3 ft, and slips by 1 ft, which means he is essentially climbing only 2 ft. He can only climb successfully if exactly 3 fts are remaining from the topmost point. In this case, he will not slip because he has landed on the top point. For the lengths less than 3 ft, he will fall over the pillar, and comes down. The program reads a number P, length of the pillar and prints YES if monkey can successfully climb this pillar, NO otherwise.

_Test Case:_
```
10
NO
```

```
11
YES
```
