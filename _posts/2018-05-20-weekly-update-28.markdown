The summer vacation is taking its impost. I know it is not easy to get going, but you are letting go of the time that would never return. All of you are very far from leveling up, and this is the time you can put hard work to lay a good foundation for your aspirations. Remember that the points you have accumulated are going in vain if you don’t work on a regular basis. Please please just get started, and you will realize that it was all that was required. You are not trying if have not yet begun.  

This week has been rather silent. I have not seen or heard much. None of you have solved even a single PSET problem. And I don't think I should tell its severity if you don't realize that it was you who wanted to learn this.

## Bad things will happen
Despite multiple requests, you are not addressing the GitHub issues. I'm thus closing all your previous issues (including peer reviews) without any resolution. And please keep all communication at one place (as I mentioned in last week update), it's quite difficult otherwise.

## Nevertheless, some suggestions
- Important! Slow and steady wins the race. Keep moving daily. Don't break your schedule.
- Keep your programs/algorithms/solutions adequately organized in your computer and in GitHub to save time during future use.
- Adding problem/objective statement at the top of the program in comments can be useful during writing code and also for the future reference.
- Learn to comment your code to keep your code understandable by not just you but others. Adding comments help avoid situations when you’re too busy writing code, and you feel distracted by smallest of the interruptions.
- Develop your approach to solve problems. Should you do a flow chart first? Alternatively, solve the test cases on the paper? Evolve a system of solving that works for you.
- Declare/ initialize variables before you use. In this way, you avoid errors related to un-declaration of variables.
- Indent and format your code for readability.
- Use meaningful names for variables and functions or else forget reading your code in the future.
- Trace through your program to double check accuracy or fallacy.
- Keep a check on the different colors in your code editor that indicates what a pre-defined keyword, or which ones are variables or which one is a string, or anything else. Avoid common errors.
- Avoid copy/paste.
- Do not cheat yourself. Only you know if you understood the logic or not.
- You are not your code. Criticism of your code isn't a criticism of you.
- Don't go dark. Share your unfinished work with willingly.
- Test your work. Try writing tests before code.
- Be OK with you. You will never know everything - that is impossible. Keep learning, but don't get caught up on what you don't know.
- Multi-tasking is an illusion (or maybe not). However, computers get away with it because they can context switch fast (most of the time). Do one thing at a time, and do it well.

## Tell me something good!
Okay, there is some good news. Apoorva is gaining momentum in her project, and it is going well. Also, she has written an algorithm to list permutations of a given list for the Hamiltonian cycles, which is a brilliant attempt in itself and all of you should look how she developed it. Maybe Apoorva should tell us how she came up with this algorithm (and rating in her wiki).

## What's new?
- DecodeVector repository is now licensed under MIT License. That means anyone else can use the source code of our website for their community freely. These are small ways through which we can return a favor to developer community who distributes a lot of free and open software like Atom, P5.JS, and Python, etc. Read our license [here]( https://github.com/mathscapes/DecodeVector/blob/master/LICENSE).
- Code of Conduct is now integrated into our GitHub repo which will be shown to the members from time to time to ensure all of us are aware of it.

## And so far...
- Most PSET problems solved (this week): None
- Most PSET problems solved (all time): Simran (29)
- Most rating (this week): Apoorva*
- Most rating (all-time): Apoorva*
- Best streak: Simran (04/05/2018-08/05/2018 .. 5 days)
- Most PSET problems solved in one day: Simran (04/04/2018 .. 9 problems, 16/04/2018 .. 9 problems)

\*Apoorva’s rating will be added once she updates it.
