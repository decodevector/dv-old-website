It has been a long journey in DV for me, probably the longest as the first student of this ‘5th edition’ of the gang of new theoretical computer science enthusiasts every year, who get together with the benevolent dictator (Gaurav), and learn how to speak to a computer and solve problems through programming.

Let me put out my current status out there first: I have just 3 points, after 82 days and 28 problems as per our daily rating system. As of now, just ‘being in the game’ has been my greatest achievement - or so I tell myself.

What I can, therefore, share with you today, is more of ‘what not to do’, to be good at Decode Vector.

## Don't skip

It is NOT Impossible to learn how to code if you are willing to work on it daily. My other teammates are either at (Apoorva), or approaching (Simran) Level1 (100+ points) thanks to their dedication, and daily efforts. And, Pranjal, our third teammate is keeping afloat much better than I, at this point. And I, the fourth, strive to stay in the game, frantically trying to upload a solved PSET problem each time, before the date changes. This is because I skip days, and to add to it, on many days, I may not complete a problem. So skipping is probably not a good idea.

## Don't be afraid

Its been ages since I did maths problems and the time-gap has taken a toll. Things that you might need only to brush up, demands a thorough revisit from me to be able to apply them when I attempt a PSET problem. I’ve only recently brought my old books and notes of class 9th and 10th from home to study maths - get back to the basics - again. And, my DV gang has gifted me an R D Sharma :) I absolutely love my team! So toss that ‘maths fear’ away!

## Don't be shy

If you want to learn something, you have to overcome the fear of being judged. I shamelessly ping Simran when I’m stuck, and who’s saved me from the edge like a trusted comrade, each time. So have Apoorva and Pranjal been my teachers at Decode Vector, whenever I’ve gotten stuck. I’m a learner in this space, though I may be a faculty in another. So park that shyness aside!

## Don't take things for granted
There is NEVER one way to solve a problem. Neither is there ever ONE best approach to something. The overarching rule is - question and analyze everything that you are doing - so that you move ahead confidently. If you don’t, you’ll get stuck at the immediate next step. So don’t accept if you don’t understand.

## Don't give up
I never thought I could code. Now I can code. Its baby steps, but we were all babies one day - be it Linus Torvalds (creator of Linux) or Guido van Rossum (author of the Python programming language). There is only one key I know of, that I can pass on to you today, that I know opens all doors in life - it is called ‘NOT GIVING UP’ - THE ONLY GUARANTEED WAY TO SUCCESS.

So, DON'T DELAY, JUST BEGIN. You might just surprise yourself!

## And so far…
- Most PSET problems solved (this week): Simran (7)
- Most PSET problems solved (all-time): Apoorva (55+)
- Most rating (this week): Apoorva (137)
- Most rating (all-time): Apoorva (137)
- Best streak: Simran (13/06/2018-02/07/2018 .. 19 days)
- Most PSET problems solved in one day: Apoorva (29/04/2018 .. 14 problems)
