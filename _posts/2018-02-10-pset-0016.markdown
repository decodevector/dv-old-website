In mathematics, Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients. The rows of Pascal's triangle are conventionally enumerated starting with row $n = 0$ at the top (the $0$ th row). The entries in each row are numbered from the left beginning with $k = 0$ and are usually staggered relative to the numbers in the adjacent rows. The triangle may be constructed in the following manner: In row $0$ (the topmost row), there is a unique nonzero entry $1$. Each entry of each subsequent row is constructed by adding the number above and to the left with the number above and to the right, treating blank entries as $0$. For example, the initial number in the first (or any other) row is $1$ (the sum of $0$ and $1$), whereas the numbers $1$ and $3$ in the third row are added to produce the number $4$ in the fourth row.

Read a number $N$ in a Python program and print $N$ lines of Pascal's triangle.
