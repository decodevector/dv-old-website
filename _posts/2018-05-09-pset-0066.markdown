_The following problem is taken from Project Euler._

$n!$ means $n × (n − 1) × ... × 3 × 2 × 1$

For example, $10! = 10 × 9 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3628800$,
and the sum of the digits in the number $10!$ is $3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 27$.

Find the <span title="The whole is more than the sum of its parts. - Aristotle, 
Metaphysica 10f-1045a">sum</span> of the digits in the number $100!$.
