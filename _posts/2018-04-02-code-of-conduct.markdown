<big>This Code is not exhaustive or complete. It is not a rulebook; it serves to distil our collective understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and goals. We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in this document.</big>

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the DecodeVector group, as well as steps to reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring group for all and expect our code of conduct to be honored. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be asked to exit from the group.

### Our DecodeVector group strives to:
* Be friendly and patient.
* *Be welcoming:* We strive to be a group that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities.
* *Be considerate:* Your work will be used by other people, and you, in turn, will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect other members, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions.
* *Be respectful:* Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack.
* *Be careful with the words that we choose:* We are a group of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other members.
* *Try to understand why we disagree:* Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is essential that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of our group comes from its diversity, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.

### Leadership, authority, and responsibility
We all lead by example, in debate and in action. We encourage new members to feel empowered to lead, to take action, and to experiment when they feel innovation could improve the project. Leadership can be exercised by anyone simply by taking action, there is no need to wait for recognition when the opportunity to lead presents itself.

#### Delegation from the top
Responsibility within DecodeVector starts with the "benevolent dictator", who delegates specific responsibilities and the corresponding authority to a series of teams. Its delegated representative will arbitrate in any dispute.

**We are a meritocracy**; we delegate decision making, organisation and leadership from senior bodies to the most able and engaged candidates.

DecodeVector group runs through linear organisation -- which means the position and relations of leader and sub-member are arranged and oriented vertically. Each leader has clearly assigned sub-members and each sub-members has clearly assigned leader. The role is decided on a timely basis based on the [rating](/sub/rating-system/) of the member.

#### We value discussion, data and decisiveness
We gather opinions, data and commitments from concerned members before taking a decision. We expect leaders to help teams come to a decision in a reasonable time, to seek guidance or be willing to take the decision themselves when consensus is lacking, and to take responsibility for implementation.

The poorest decision of all is no decision: clarity of direction has value in itself. Sometimes all the data are not available, or consensus is elusive. A decision must still be made. There is no guarantee of a perfect decision every time - we prefer to err, learn, and err less in future than to postpone action indefinitely.

#### Teamwork
A leader's foremost goal is the success of the team, and not just his/her own progress.
A leader knows when to act and when to step back. They know when to delegate work, and when to take it upon themselves.

#### Courage and considerateness
Leadership occasionally requires bold decisions that will not be widely understood, agreed by everyone or popular. We value the courage to take such decisions, because they enable the DecodeVector as a whole to move forward faster than we could if we required complete consensus. Nevertheless, boldness demands considerateness; take bold decisions, but do so mindful of the challenges they present for others, and work to soften the impact of those decisions on them. Communicating changes and their reasoning clearly and early on is as important as the implementation of the change itself.

### Conflicts of interest
We expect leaders to be aware when they are conflicted due to personal schedule or other projects they are involved in, and abstain or delegate decisions that may be seen to be self-interested. We expect that everyone who participates in DecodeVector does so with the goal of progress of DecodeVector.

When in doubt, ask for a second opinion. Perceived conflicts of interest are important to address; as a leader, act to ensure that decisions are credible even if they must occasionally be unpopular, difficult or favourable to the interests of one group over another.

### Diversity Statement
We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a group for all. Although we will fail at times, we seek to treat everyone both as fairly and equally as possible. Whenever a member has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do our best to right the wrong.
