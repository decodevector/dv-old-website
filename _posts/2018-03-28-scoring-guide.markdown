Score can be calculated by

$$ D' + \phi \sum_{p=0}^{m/10} p s_{10p} + \sum_{j=0}^{n}p_j x_j $$

where,

$ D' = 2D - T $ where, $D$ is the number of days you've solved at least one PSET problem, and $T$ is the total number of days since your date of join.

$ \sum_{i=0}^{n}p_i x_i $ is the sum of all the points scored in each problem solved by you.
