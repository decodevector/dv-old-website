_The following problem is taken from Project Euler._

The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

$F_n = F_{n−1} + F_{n−2}$, where $F_1 = 1$ and $F_2 = 1$

Hence the first $12$ terms will be:

$$
    F_1 = 1 \\
    F_2 = 1 \\
    F_3 = 2 \\
    F_4 = 3 \\
    F_5 = 5 \\
    F_6 = 8 \\
    F_7 = 13 \\
    F_8 = 21 \\
    F_9 = 34 \\
    F_{10} = 55 \\
    F_{11} = 89 \\
    F_{12} = 144 \\

$$

The $12$th term, $F_{12}$, is the first term to contain three digits.

What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain $1000$ digits?
