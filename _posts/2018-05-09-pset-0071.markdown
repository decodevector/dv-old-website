_The following problem is taken from Project Euler._

The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

    $F_n = F_{n−1} + F_{n−2}$, where $F_1 = 1 and F_2 = 1$

Hence the first $12$ terms will be:

$$
    F_1 = 1
    F_2 = 1
    F_3 = 2
    F_4 = 3
    F_5 = 5
    F_6 = 8
    F_7 = 13
    F_8 = 21
    F_9 = 34
    F_10 = 55
    F_11 = 89
    F_12 = 144

$$

The $12$th term, $F_12$, is the first term to contain three digits.

What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain $1000$ digits?
