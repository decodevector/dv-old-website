### What is Factorial?
In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer $n$, denoted by $n!$, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to $n$. For example,
image

$$ 5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120 $$

The value of $0!$ is $1$, according to the convention for an empty product.
