_The following problem is taken from Project Euler._

A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are given:

$$ \frac{1}{2}	= 	0.5 $$

$$ \frac{1}{3}	= 	0.(3) $$

$$ \frac{1}{4}	= 	0.25 $$

$$ \frac{1}{5}	= 	0.2 $$

$$ \frac{1}{6}	= 	0.1(6) $$

$$ \frac{1}{7}	= 	0.(142857) $$

$$ \frac{1}{8}	= 	0.125 $$

$$ \frac{1}{9}	= 	0.(1) $$

$$ \frac{1}{10}	= 	0.1 $$

Where $0.1(6)$ means $0.166666...$, and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen that $\frac{1}{7}$ has a 6-digit recurring cycle.

Find the value of $d \lt 1000$ for which $\frac{1}{d}$ contains the longest recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part.
