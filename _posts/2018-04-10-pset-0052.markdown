_The following problem is taken from Project Euler._

The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:

$ n → \frac{n}{2} $ ($n$ is even)

$ n → 3n + 1 $ ($n$ is odd)

Using the rule above and starting with $13$, we generate the following sequence:

$$13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1$$

It can be seen that this sequence (starting at $13$ and finishing at $1$) contains $10$ terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1.

Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?

_NOTE: Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million._
