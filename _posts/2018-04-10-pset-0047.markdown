_The following problem is taken from Project Euler._

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, $a < b < c$, for which,

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

For example, $ 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2 $.

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which $a + b + c = 1000$.

Find the product $abc$.
