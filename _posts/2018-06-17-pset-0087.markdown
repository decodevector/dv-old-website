_The following problem is taken from Project Euler._

Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:

$$n^2+n+41$$

It turns out that the formula will produce $40$ primes for the consecutive integer values $0≤n≤39$
. However, when $n=40,402+40+41=40(40+1)+41$ is divisible by $41$, and certainly when $n=41,412+41+41$ is clearly divisible by $41$.

The incredible formula $n^2−79n+1601$ was discovered, which produces $80$ primes for the consecutive values $0≤n≤79$. The product of the coefficients, $−79$ and $1601$, is $−126479$.

Considering quadratics of the form:

$$ n^2+an+b $$

where $\mod{a}<1000$ and $\mod{b}≤1000$\\
where $\mod{n}$ is the modulus/absolute value of $n$\\

e.g. $\mod{11}=11$ and $\mod{−4}=4$

Find the product of the coefficients, $a$ and $b$, for the quadratic expression that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of $n$, starting with $n=0$.
