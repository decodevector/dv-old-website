I think it would be safe to say that last week's update left each of us wanting to point our compasses back to dv,  because while it gets difficult to attain the same kind of focus and attention as we together achieve in our N5's room of requirement, it does not formulate itself to be an excuse. We're all very capable people and should be standing by our word, since DecodeVector is something we all want to learn from.

Having said that, I feel like I understand perspectives of us all working our way through summer, trying to sustain our scores to get back stronger and more confident. But I also get that it really doesn't come easy. From getting caught up in work with the house, to traveling to different places or meeting up with people I'm bound to meet over the summer, to also finally finding some time and still being unproductive at it, it took me a little over a month to realise what I'm going to label 'Debug' to pull my way through it all. The balance is essential, and so is keeping yourself motivated. And I'll tell you what helped me realise that.

I come from a family of CS engineers, people who are so enthusiastic about math and science that I feel the same energy in N5 every evening. I like to think that I surround myself with that like-mindedness and people open to discussing ideas and opinions and are generally appreciative of the same. But over the past few weeks, I didn't have that around me. My sister and my dad both live in different cities, so the little motivation I could get, was only from getting in touch with my peers, Apoorva and Vineeta that has helped me so far.

Because of these little instances, I've come to realise that in addition to doing something I like, I'm a person driven by people around me, their belief in seeing potential in me. But that also comes up to expectations and the fear of disappointing them, which acts as a good motivator for me.

But that's just me. Finding out what motivates you, or knowing what doesn't, can really help you align your vector to productivity. I personally made sure I was either talking to my father or my roommate to keep myself reminded of why I'm working for this and what I want to achieve out of it.

Here's my list of debugging tips, you could try and see if they work for you (I'm a struggler myself; let me know if I should do something differently!) :

## General programming advice

- Time yourself: Lowers the chances of procrastination
- Don't push it if it's not happening: By this I don't mean give up altogether. Take a break. It's okay if you don't complete the problem in one go. It's important you enjoy solving it!
- If you've been doing well lately, Streak it! : If you get into the habit of updating your score daily, you'll see how much you can pull yourself up by doing so little regularly. It is motivating to see the numbers go up
- Don't stop after solving one: I've seen from experience that solutions show up as a domino effect sometimes
- Don't associate the difficulty of the problem with the points
- Pick more than just one problem and work on them simultaneously: Switch between them if they seem to meet a dead end, and come back to them later.
- Collaborate: Or ask fellow DVas. We're all the same!
- Don't worry about the score: Contrary to popular belief, keep sustained efforts in place and the score will go up on it's own. Don't solve the problems for points


## Balancing DV and everything else

- Find your zone: I can't emphasise enough how important this is! If it's music, or your spot by the window, your your desk away from people. Find it. Reserve it. Utilise it. Use it to focus on your problem at hand.
- Cut out the distractions: I went back to my board examination habit of keeping my water bottle and snacks ready in place, and cellphone off.
- Assign a convenient time, with buffers around it to ensure you're able to get it regularly
- Put yourself first! While other things seem important, prioritise. Is it really worth compromising this over?
- There's fun associated to solving problems if you can find yourself doing them stress-free.

I would say this as a reminder to myself, or put it on a stickie in my room if I were home, but I'll share it with my fellow DVas as well:

> You are your own excuse, and your own motivator. Leverage this extra time as much as you can, there is still time till all the workload adds to this and takes the joy out of it.

Knowledge is power!

Also guys the world will be doomed if we don't learn how to tackle AI lets save the world and DecodeVector.

Good luck!
