    <p>Its been 27 weeks(!) since we started this group, which we call as DecodeVector now. Honest efforts have been taken by all of the members to not just keeping it alive but making it stronger, which is great!</p>

<p>Starting from now, I will be writing weekly logs to summarise the progress we make as a group and glimpse of the coming weeks to plan better and updating ourselves to keep aligned to our long-term roadmap.</p>

<h2 id="keeping-our-communication-organized">Keeping our communication organized</h2>
<p>It is essential that we keep most (if not all) of our conversation related to DV at one place. We currently have GitHub Issues and #DecodeVector channel of HCD Slack workspace for communication, but it goes to Email/WhatsApp/Slack DMs which is not okay. The problem that I foresee is that we will be doing a lot of rework in future since we make a lot of one-on-one or closed group conversation which will eventually be required for others. I thus suggest if we try to keep our communication only over GitHub (for all important queries about PSET, review, website) and Slack for general correspondence.</p>

<h2 id="peer-review-and-ghost-issues-in-github">Peer review and ghost issues in GitHub</h2>
<p>Thank you Vineeta and Simran for thoroughly doing the review for Apoorva. Peer review will be helpful for both learnings and be scrutinized for any wrong-doings(if there are any). The others have not been yet reviewed, and this needs to be done as early as possible. Please please mark your daily progress on your wiki not to accumulate pending. There will be more peer reviews in future, so be ready!</p>

<p>And leverage GitHub issues feature! Assign a right person who you want to ask, appropriate labels and title. And others are expected to keep a check on their email and GitHub notifications to track if they have any pending issues. Most of the times, someone’s issue just lie there not responded, and that’s not okay. Let’s all of us be accountable towards each other and respond to the issues were assigned to help each other.</p>

<h2 id="self-studying">Self-studying</h2>
<p>I’m pleasantly surprised how you all are taking other courses or books to learn Python or other relevant subjects to gain more understanding. While it’s all good, only if you had paid more attention to the class, you would realize that you are already exposed to the information required to do PSETs. Nevertheless, I would encourage self-studying from other sources to gain more knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="delay-in-the-project-timelines">Delay in the project timelines</h2>
<p>The delay in your respective projects in unacceptable and since it was all voluntary, you are responsible for taking care of keeping up with the time. Please have a word with me, and let’s rethink your timelines to accomplish your goals within summer break.</p>

<h2 id="whats-new">Whats new?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>New PSET problems added (0062-0072).</li>
  <li>Fixed minor issues in PSET problems pointed out in GitHub issues.</li>
  <li>New issue templates on GitHub issues (try creating a new issue to learn more!)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="and-so-far">And so far…</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Most PSET problems solved (this week): Pranjal (6)</li>
  <li>Most PSET problems solved (all time): Simran (29)</li>
  <li>Most rating (this week): Apoorva*</li>
  <li>Most rating (all time): Apoorva*</li>
  <li>Best streak: Simran (04/05/2018-08/05/2018 .. 5 days)</li>
  <li>Most PSET problems solved in one day: Simran (04/04/2018 .. 9 problems, 16/04/2018 .. 9 problems)</li>
</ul>

<p>*Apoorva’s rating will be added once she updates it.</p>
