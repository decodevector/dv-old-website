    <p>It is moments like these which make me question if I’m not doing enough to keep the energy alive. Repeating, it’s not going to come any easy. You’ll have to put in efforts, and only then you will reap its benefit. But, first, you have to start doing and do it daily. Well, the price you pay is a part of your time every day goes into this. And that will help you build the habit, habit of learning and practicing. Will you pay this price to reap the unknown? </p>

<p>This week was no different from the past, same old story of scarce attempts and continuation of ignoring my requests. Everyone seems quite involved in their own business and have forgotten their word. It’s not going to work this way. Three of you are just about to slip, and I hope you are aware what will it take to start all over again (from the screening) post-summer.</p>

<p><em>Why hurry up?</em></p>

<p>Well, there’s nothing wrong with self-paced. And speeding up without compromising on conceptual understanding is very difficult. The reason, why I emphasize on pace has a two-fold purpose - one that it will push you to take efforts on a daily basis which will help you make problem-solving as a habit and secondly because of the nature of technology itself. Theoretical CS and digital technology are advancing at an unprecedented rate, and as designers who have little to no formal background in fundamentals of CS, it’s very very difficult to be even get acquainted with tools and models, forget solving the problems through the lens of computation. There’s ML, AI, NLP, AGI, AR, VR and what not! But there is good news — that we have access to an abundance of resources - courses, book, tools on the internet that let you learn at your pace. But the catch is you will have to do it yourself; you will have to motivate yourself to get going and most likely if you’re not strong enough, you will lose the progress. All I can say now is that you can leverage from DV.</p>

<h2 id="if-this-then-what">If this then what?</h2>

<p>Appreciate yourself that you’re today able to code by yourself and you have achieved this in so less (D)ays. I’m sure you cannot imagine what you’ll be like if you do it regularly. I’m hopeful that one of you will soon reach level 1 and help express why daily efforts are non-negotiable.</p>

<h2 id="whats-new">What’s new?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>New PSET problems added (0073-0082)</li>
  <li>New website feature: <a href="/search">Search!</a> You can now quickly search PSETs, notes or anything on the website through this</li>
  <li>Captions for each weekly update</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="and-so-far">And so far…</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Most PSET problems solved (this week): Apoorva (unknown)</li>
  <li>Most PSET problems solved (all-time): Simran (29)</li>
  <li>Most rating (this week): Apoorva (unknown)</li>
  <li>Most rating (all-time): Apoorva (unknown)</li>
  <li>Best streak: Simran (04/05/2018-08/05/2018 .. 5 days)</li>
  <li>Most PSET problems solved in one day: Simran (04/04/2018 .. 9 problems, 16/04/2018 .. 9 problems)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Anyone who can make Apoorva mark her PSET progress correctly on her wiki will be rewarded.</em></p>

  <p>“Suppose that you want to teach the ‘cat’ concept to a very young child. Do you explain that a cat is a relatively small, primarily carnivorous mammal with retractable claws, a distinctive sonic output, etc.? I’ll bet not. You probably show the kid a lot of different cats, saying ‘kitty’ each time, until it gets the idea. To put it more generally, generalizations are best made by abstraction from experience.” — R. P. Boas (Can we make mathematics inteligible?, American Mathematical Monthly 88 (1981), pp. 727-731)</p>
