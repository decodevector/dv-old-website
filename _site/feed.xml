      <content type="html" xml:base="http://decodevector.mathscapes.xyz//sub/weekly-update-30/">&lt;p&gt;Finally, I’m starting to see the sprouts above the ground. Thank you for reciprocating after last week’s update. I hope you soon see a positive impact of efforts that you’re taking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It’s not that I’m so smart, it’s just that I stay with problems longer.” - Albert Einstein&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it is difficult to keep up with DV on a daily basis, but that’s how it is. You have to put yourself in an uncomfortable position. And not putting enough efforts in DV daily will only make it harder for you and you will be helpless to complete the PSET problems in lesser time (and possibly adopt unfair means to do it). Be resilient and honest! All I want from you is to take genuine efforts on a regular basis to understand this lens of computation. As long as you continue to make efforts, you will keep solving the PSETs at the required pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can see that sometimes you feel that you should know more, especially about the programming language (Python in this case) itself to solve PSET problem. But sooner or later you will realize that learning to code mostly involves the right attitude and problem-solving capabilities and everything else is secondary. The syntax and constructs of the language will be given to you as you progress and are apt at your level. All I’m saying is that sometimes you make your job difficult by learning something before you should have. I intend (through PSETs) that you have enough practice to understand and familiarize before you acquire a shortcut to do that. For instance, there is a sort method available in Python to sort your list variable, but I have avoided so far so that you can learn how it works and code it by yourself. I hope you’ll appreciate the thought behind this later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;simran&quot;&gt;Simran&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You’re finally able to do DV daily. Continue with your efforts and focus on your streak.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Good work on updating your progress on the wiki.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Please add comments to your programs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use meaningful names for the variables and functions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add meaningful commit messages.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Avoid &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;global&lt;/code&gt;. Instead, read the variables from function argument and return the values to update those variables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;apoorva&quot;&gt;Apoorva&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Good work on sustained efforts minus wiki.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Please add comments to your programs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use meaningful names for the variables and functions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add meaningful commit messages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vineeta&quot;&gt;Vineeta&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You’re queuing at the exit door. Good luck!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pranjal&quot;&gt;Pranjal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Good work on sustained efforts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Please add comments to your programs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use meaningful names for the variables and functions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add meaningful commit messages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-new&quot;&gt;What’s New?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I have been experimenting with look and feel of the website. You will see new changes (work in progress) in this week’s update.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;and-so-far&quot;&gt;And so far…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most PSET problems solved (this week): Simran (6)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most PSET problems solved (all-time): Simran (38)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most rating (this week): Simran (20)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most rating (all-time): Unknown&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Best streak: Simran (04/05/2018-08/05/2018 .. 5 days)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most PSET problems solved in one day: Simran (04/04/2018 .. 9 problems, 16/04/2018 .. 9 problems)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;warning&quot;&gt;Warning!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One or more of you is/are found to be copying the code from the internet, and this is super serious! Your small violation might cost you exit from DV. Whoever you are (of course, I know who), please accept your offense it on #decodevector on the slack and don’t repeat this within DV again. You are enforcing me to make the rating system even more stringent for all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways that’s all for this week. Happy Monsoon and Happy (de)coding!&lt;/p&gt;

      <published>2018-05-27T23:25:00+05:30</published>
      <updated>2018-05-27T23:25:00+05:30</updated>
      <id>http://decodevector.mathscapes.xyz//sub/weekly-update-29</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="http://decodevector.mathscapes.xyz//sub/weekly-update-29/">&lt;p&gt;It is moments like these which make me question if I’m not doing enough to keep the energy alive. Repeating, it’s not going to come any easy. You’ll have to put in efforts, and only then you will reap its benefit. But, first, you have to start doing and do it daily. Well, the price you pay is a part of your time every day goes into this. And that will help you build the habit, habit of learning and practicing. Will you pay this price to reap the unknown? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week was no different from the past, same old story of scarce attempts and continuation of ignoring my requests. Everyone seems quite involved in their own business and have forgotten their word. It’s not going to work this way. Three of you are just about to slip, and I hope you are aware what will it take to start all over again (from the screening) post-summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why hurry up?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, there’s nothing wrong with self-paced. And speeding up without compromising on conceptual understanding is very difficult. The reason, why I emphasize on pace has a two-fold purpose - one that it will push you to take efforts on a daily basis which will help you make problem-solving as a habit and secondly because of the nature of technology itself. Theoretical CS and digital technology are advancing at an unprecedented rate, and as designers who have little to no formal background in fundamentals of CS, it’s very very difficult to be even get acquainted with tools and models, forget solving the problems through the lens of computation. There’s ML, AI, NLP, AGI, AR, VR and what not! But there is good news — that we have access to an abundance of resources - courses, book, tools on the internet that let you learn at your pace. But the catch is you will have to do it yourself; you will have to motivate yourself to get going and most likely if you’re not strong enough, you will lose the progress. All I can say now is that you can leverage from DV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;if-this-then-what&quot;&gt;If this then what?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appreciate yourself that you’re today able to code by yourself and you have achieved this in so less (D)ays. I’m sure you cannot imagine what you’ll be like if you do it regularly. I’m hopeful that one of you will soon reach level 1 and help express why daily efforts are non-negotiable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/week-29-chart.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure your pattern&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Writing this in big words, so you don’t miss this again. Please route your issues on GitHub whether you want to ask me or anyone else. Don’t use slack for clearing your code issues whatsoever. I have explained the reason in W27 update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-new&quot;&gt;What’s new?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New PSET problems added (0073-0082)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New website feature: &lt;a href=&quot;/search&quot;&gt;Search!&lt;/a&gt; You can now quickly search PSETs, notes or anything on the website through this&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Captions for each weekly update&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;and-so-far&quot;&gt;And so far…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most PSET problems solved (this week): Apoorva (unknown)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most PSET problems solved (all-time): Simran (29)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most rating (this week): Apoorva (unknown)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most rating (all-time): Apoorva (unknown)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Best streak: Simran (04/05/2018-08/05/2018 .. 5 days)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most PSET problems solved in one day: Simran (04/04/2018 .. 9 problems, 16/04/2018 .. 9 problems)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anyone who can make Apoorva mark her PSET progress correctly on her wiki will be rewarded.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Suppose that you want to teach the ‘cat’ concept to a very young child. Do you explain that a cat is a relatively small, primarily carnivorous mammal with retractable claws, a distinctive sonic output, etc.? I’ll bet not. You probably show the kid a lot of different cats, saying ‘kitty’ each time, until it gets the idea. To put it more generally, generalizations are best made by abstraction from experience.” — R. P. Boas (Can we make mathematics inteligible?, American Mathematical Monthly 88 (1981), pp. 727-731)&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html" xml:base="http://decodevector.mathscapes.xyz//sub/weekly-update-28/">&lt;p&gt;The summer vacation is taking its impost. I know it is not easy to get going, but you are letting go of the time that would never return. All of you are very far from leveling up, and this is the time you can put hard work to lay a good foundation for your aspirations. Remember that the points you have accumulated are going in vain if you don’t work on a regular basis. Please please just get started, and you will realize that it was all that was required. You are not trying if have not yet begun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week has been rather silent. I have not seen or heard much. None of you have solved even a single PSET problem. And I don’t think I should tell its severity if you don’t realize that it was you who wanted to learn this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bad-things-will-happen&quot;&gt;Bad things will happen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite multiple requests, you are not addressing the GitHub issues. I’m thus closing all your previous issues (including peer reviews) without any resolution. And please keep all communication at one place (as I mentioned in last week update), it’s quite difficult otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nevertheless-some-suggestions&quot;&gt;Nevertheless, some suggestions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Important! Slow and steady wins the race. Keep moving daily. Don’t break your schedule.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep your programs/algorithms/solutions adequately organized in your computer and in GitHub to save time during future use.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adding problem/objective statement at the top of the program in comments can be useful during writing code and also for the future reference.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn to comment your code to keep your code understandable by not just you but others. Adding comments help avoid situations when you’re too busy writing code, and you feel distracted by smallest of the interruptions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Develop your approach to solve problems. Should you do a flow chart first? Alternatively, solve the test cases on the paper? Evolve a system of solving that works for you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Declare/Initialize variables before you use. In this way, you avoid errors related to un-declaration of variables.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Indent and format your code for readability.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use meaningful names for variables and functions or else forget reading your code in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Trace through your program to double check accuracy or fallacy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep a check on the different colors in your code editor that indicates what a pre-defined keyword, or which ones are variables or which one is a string, or anything else. Avoid common errors.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Avoid copy/paste.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not cheat yourself. Only you know if you understood the logic or not.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You are not your code. Criticism of your code isn’t a criticism of you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t go dark. Share your unfinished work with willingly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Test your work. Try writing tests before code.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be OK with you. You will never know everything - that is impossible. Keep learning, but don’t get caught up on what you don’t know.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Multi-tasking is an illusion (or maybe not). However, computers get away with it because they can context switch fast (most of the time). Do one thing at a time, and do it well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tell-me-something-good&quot;&gt;Tell me something good!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, there is some good news. Apoorva is gaining momentum in her project, and it is going well. Also, she has written an algorithm to list permutations of a given list for the Hamiltonian cycles, which is a brilliant attempt in itself and all of you should look how she developed it. Maybe Apoorva should tell us how she came up with this algorithm (and rating in her wiki).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-new&quot;&gt;What’s new?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DecodeVector repository is now licensed under MIT License. That means anyone else can use the source code of our website for their community freely. These are small ways through which we can return a favor to developer community who distributes a lot of free and open software like Atom, P5.JS, and Python, etc. Read our license &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mathscapes/DecodeVector/blob/master/LICENSE&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Code of Conduct is now integrated into our GitHub repo which will be shown to the members from time to time to ensure all of us are aware of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;and-so-far&quot;&gt;And so far…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most PSET problems solved (this week): None&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most PSET problems solved (all time): Simran (29)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most rating (this week): Apoorva (unknown)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most rating (all-time): Apoorva (unknown)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Best streak: Simran (04/05/2018-08/05/2018 .. 5 days)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most PSET problems solved in one day: Simran (04/04/2018 .. 9 problems, 16/04/2018 .. 9 problems)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <link href="http://decodevector.mathscapes.xyz//sub/weekly-update-27/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Week 27: Deliberately naive" />
      <published>2018-05-13T17:15:00+05:30</published>
      <updated>2018-05-13T17:15:00+05:30</updated>
      <id>http://decodevector.mathscapes.xyz//sub/weekly-update-27</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="http://decodevector.mathscapes.xyz//sub/weekly-update-27/">&lt;p&gt;Its been 27 weeks(!) since we started this group, which we call as DecodeVector now. Honest efforts have been taken by all of the members to not just keeping it alive but making it stronger, which is great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting from now, I will be writing weekly logs to summarise the progress we make as a group and glimpse of the coming weeks to plan better and updating ourselves to keep aligned to our long-term roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;keeping-our-communication-organized&quot;&gt;Keeping our communication organized&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is essential that we keep most (if not all) of our conversation related to DV at one place. We currently have GitHub Issues and #DecodeVector channel of HCD Slack workspace for communication, but it goes to Email/WhatsApp/Slack DMs which is not okay. The problem that I foresee is that we will be doing a lot of rework in future since we make a lot of one-on-one or closed group conversation which will eventually be required for others. I thus suggest if we try to keep our communication only over GitHub (for all important queries about PSET, review, website) and Slack for general correspondence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;peer-review-and-ghost-issues-in-github&quot;&gt;Peer review and ghost issues in GitHub&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you Vineeta and Simran for thoroughly doing the review for Apoorva. Peer review will be helpful for both learnings and be scrutinized for any wrong-doings(if there are any). The others have not been yet reviewed, and this needs to be done as early as possible. Please please mark your daily progress on your wiki not to accumulate pending. There will be more peer reviews in future, so be ready!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And leverage GitHub issues feature! Assign a right person who you want to ask, appropriate labels and title. And others are expected to keep a check on their email and GitHub notifications to track if they have any pending issues. Most of the times, someone’s issue just lie there not responded, and that’s not okay. Let’s all of us be accountable towards each other and respond to the issues were assigned to help each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;self-studying&quot;&gt;Self-studying&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m pleasantly surprised how you all are taking other courses or books to learn Python or other relevant subjects to gain more understanding. While it’s all good, only if you had paid more attention to the class, you would realize that you are already exposed to the information required to do PSETs. Nevertheless, I would encourage self-studying from other sources to gain more knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;delay-in-the-project-timelines&quot;&gt;Delay in the project timelines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The delay in your respective projects in unacceptable and since it was all voluntary, you are responsible for taking care of keeping up with the time. Please have a word with me, and let’s rethink your timelines to accomplish your goals within summer break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-new&quot;&gt;Whats new?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New PSET problems added (0062-0072).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed minor issues in PSET problems pointed out in GitHub issues.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New issue templates on GitHub issues (try creating a new issue to learn more!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;and-so-far&quot;&gt;And so far…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most PSET problems solved (this week): Pranjal (6)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most PSET problems solved (all time): Simran (29)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most rating (this week): Apoorva (unknown)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most rating (all time): Apoorva (unknown)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Best streak: Simran (04/05/2018-08/05/2018 .. 5 days)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most PSET problems solved in one day: Simran (04/04/2018 .. 9 problems, 16/04/2018 .. 9 problems)&lt;/li&gt;

      <content type="html" xml:base="http://decodevector.mathscapes.xyz//sub/pset-0071/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following problem is taken from Project Euler.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$F_n = F_{n−1} + F_{n−2}$, where $F_1 = 1$ and $F_2 = 1$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence the first $12$ terms will be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;F_1 = 1 \\
    F_2 = 1 \\
    F_3 = 2 \\
    F_4 = 3 \\
    F_5 = 5 \\
    F_6 = 8 \\

    F_{10} = 55 \\
    F_{11} = 89 \\
    F_{12} = 144 \\&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The $12$th term, $F_{12}$, is the first term to contain three digits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain $1000$ digits?&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. For example, $3124$ is one possible permutation of the digits $1, 2, 3$ and $4$. If all of the permutations are listed numerically or alphabetically, we call it lexicographic order. The lexicographic permutations of $0, 1$ and $2$ are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;’’’
012   021   102   120   201   210
‘’’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the millionth lexicographic permutation of the digits $0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8$ and $9$?&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <content type="html" xml:base="http://decodevector.mathscapes.xyz//sub/pset-0069/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following problem is taken from Project Euler.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is exactly equal to the number. For example, the sum of the proper divisors of $28$ would be $1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28$, which means that $28$ is a perfect number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number $n$ is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than $n$ and it is called abundant if this sum exceeds $n$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As $12$ is the smallest abundant number, $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16$, the smallest number that can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers is $24$. By mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all integers greater than $28123$ can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers. However, this upper limit cannot be reduced any further by analysis even though it is known that the greatest number that cannot be expressed as the sum of two abundant numbers is less than this limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find the sum of all the positive integers which cannot be written as the sum of two abundant numbers.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;a href=&quot;https://projecteuler.net/project/resources/p022_names.txt&quot;&gt;names.txt&lt;/a&gt; (right click and ‘Save Link/Target As…’), a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth $3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53$, is the $938th$ name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of $938 × 53 = 49714$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the total of all the name scores in the file?&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <content type="html" xml:base="http://decodevector.mathscapes.xyz//sub/pset-0067/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following problem is taken from Project Euler.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let $d(n)$ be defined as the sum of proper divisors of $n$ (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If $d(a) = b$ and $d(b) = a$, where $a \neq b$, then $a$ and $b$ are an amicable pair and each of $a$ and $b$ are called amicable numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the proper divisors of $220$ are $1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55$ and $110$; therefore $d(220) = 284$. The proper divisors of $284$ are $1, 2, 4, 71$ and $142$; so $d(284) = 220$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under $10000$.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
