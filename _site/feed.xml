      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/sub/pset-0084/">&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/N2tjzHzWOjQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caesar’s method is an encryption scheme involving shifting an alphabet (so $a \rightarrow c$, $b \rightarrow d$, $c \rightarrow e$, $d \rightarrow f$ , etc., $x \rightarrow z$, $y \rightarrow a$, $z \rightarrow b$). It is one of the most basic encryption methods, and is a specialized form of a transposition cipher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the alphabet is rotated, the shift is consistent. A mapping of $a \rightarrow b$, $b \rightarrow c$, etc. is termed &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ROT 1&lt;/code&gt; because the letters are shifted by one. Note that z would map to a due to the circular aspect of the rotation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/eps-gif/CaesarsMethod_800.gif&quot; alt=&quot;CaesarsMethod_800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encrypting with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ROT alpha&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ROT beta&lt;/code&gt; yields the same ciphertext if and only if &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;alpha=beta (mod 26)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ROT 13&lt;/code&gt; is a popular encryption method on the Internet since it obfuscates text sufficiently to prevent accidental reading of the text. It is commonly used to list answers of puzzles, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caesar’s method is a very weak encryption scheme, since there are 26 possibilities (of which one, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ROT 26&lt;/code&gt;, is trivial). These can be easily checked by hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write two python programs –&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(a) Reads a message and a caeser’s key (integer) and encrypts the message with the given key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(b) Reads an encrypted message and a caeser’s key (integer) and decrypt the message with the given key.&lt;/p&gt;

      <published>2018-06-17T04:45:00+05:30</published>
      <updated>2018-06-17T04:45:00+05:30</updated>
      <id>http://localhost:4000/sub/weekly-update-32</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/sub/weekly-update-32/">&lt;p&gt;I think it would be safe to say that last week’s update left each of us wanting to point our compasses back to dv,  because while it gets difficult to attain the same kind of focus and attention as we together achieve in our N5’s room of requirement, it does not formulate itself to be an excuse. We’re all very capable people and should be standing by our word, since DecodeVector is something we all want to learn from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said that, I feel like I understand perspectives of us all working our way through summer, trying to sustain our scores to get back stronger and more confident. But I also get that it really doesn’t come easy. From getting caught up in work with the house, to traveling to different places or meeting up with people I’m bound to meet over the summer, to also finally finding some time and still being unproductive at it, it took me a little over a month to realise what I’m going to label ‘Debug’ to pull my way through it all. The balance is essential, and so is keeping yourself motivated. And I’ll tell you what helped me realise that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I come from a family of CS engineers, people who are so enthusiastic about math and science that I feel the same energy in N5 every evening. I like to think that I surround myself with that like-mindedness and people open to discussing ideas and opinions and are generally appreciative of the same. But over the past few weeks, I didn’t have that around me. My sister and my dad both live in different cities, so the little motivation I could get, was only from getting in touch with my peers, Apoorva and Vineeta that has helped me so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of these little instances, I’ve come to realise that in addition to doing something I like, I’m a person driven by people around me, their belief in seeing potential in me. But that also comes up to expectations and the fear of disappointing them, which acts as a good motivator for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s just me. Finding out what motivates you, or knowing what doesn’t, can really help you align your vector to productivity. I personally made sure I was either talking to my father or my roommate to keep myself reminded of why I’m working for this and what I want to achieve out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s my list of debugging tips, you could try and see if they work for you (I’m a struggler myself; let me know if I should do something differently!) :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;general-programming-advice&quot;&gt;General programming advice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Time yourself: Lowers the chances of procrastination&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t push it if it’s not happening: By this I don’t mean give up altogether. Take a break. It’s okay if you don’t complete the problem in one go. It’s important you enjoy solving it!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you’ve been doing well lately, Streak it! : If you get into the habit of updating your score daily, you’ll see how much you can pull yourself up by doing so little regularly. It is motivating to see the numbers go up&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t stop after solving one: I’ve seen from experience that solutions show up as a domino effect sometimes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t associate the difficulty of the problem with the points&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pick more than just one problem and work on them simultaneously: Switch between them if they seem to meet a dead end, and come back to them later.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Collaborate: Or ask fellow DVas. We’re all the same!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t worry about the score: Contrary to popular belief, keep sustained efforts in place and the score will go up on it’s own. Don’t solve the problems for points&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;balancing-dv-and-everything-else&quot;&gt;Balancing DV and everything else&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find your zone: I can’t emphasise enough how important this is! If it’s music, or your spot by the window, your your desk away from people. Find it. Reserve it. Utilise it. Use it to focus on your problem at hand.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cut out the distractions: I went back to my board examination habit of keeping my water bottle and snacks ready in place, and cellphone off.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Assign a convenient time, with buffers around it to ensure you’re able to get it regularly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put yourself first! While other things seem important, prioritise. Is it really worth compromising this over?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There’s fun associated to solving problems if you can find yourself doing them stress-free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say this as a reminder to myself, or put it on a stickie in my room if I were home, but I’ll share it with my fellow DVas as well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You are your own excuse, and your own motivator. Leverage this extra time as much as you can, there is still time till all the workload adds to this and takes the joy out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge is power!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also guys the world will be doomed if we don’t learn how to tackle AI lets save the world and DecodeVector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

      <link href="http://localhost:4000/sub/weekly-update-31/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Week 31: Talking to Computers" />
      <published>2018-06-10T23:45:00+05:30</published>
      <updated>2018-06-10T23:45:00+05:30</updated>
      <id>http://localhost:4000/sub/weekly-update-31</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/sub/weekly-update-31/">&lt;p&gt;After seeing some hope last week, I was excited about this week but this week has been complete drought. I’m tired of repeating myself now if you do not take efforts, I don’t care. Despite, I will continue with what least I can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, I’m writing my account of ups and downs in learning computer science. Hopefully, you might take a lesson or two from my experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a self-taught computer programmer and started much earlier to my benefit. I was conversant with the BASIC and C++ in my early secondary school solely by sitting next to my father when he used to code at home. I think I was in awe of how computers work! I still get intrigued by simplest of the programs like Hello World! Isn’t it amazing that a few transistors and electricity together is displaying a string of characters on display! Its mind boggling that we(humans) have achieved so much and computers have now surpassed humans in many areas, and one can only imagine what can be made when humans and machine work in synergy. Together, we have this abundance of creative intelligence which has the potential to solve the biggest of the problems we have. Possibly that is why computers are called as the literacy for the 21st century. This is what excites me! Being able to talk to computers is unbelievable, it is like an additional thinking capability, computers are excellent in some of the areas where humans can only imagine. Telecommunication to Education to Space tech to watching that cat video on your phone, its all through computers! And programming is one of the undiluted ways to talk to machines. I wanted to push the envelope and investigated how I can get better and better at ‘talking’ to computers. Maths’ was the answer! The computer instructions are arithmetic operations done on hundreds to thousands of adders made from the transistors. Later, I taught myself to code on Intel 8008, and I was blown away by this marvel. I’m still very inclined to low-level programming and wanted to program in a language where I get most control of the machine which higher-level programming language prohibits. One of the key things that helped me learn programming languages without much pain was my experience with low-level languages first. I know what happens when a variable is declared or a loop is running, deep down to the memory or microprocessor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Analytical Engine weaves Algebraical patterns just as the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and leaves. - - A. Augusta, Countess of Lovelace, on Babbage’s Analytical Engine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, there is now an uncountable number of online courses available to teach programming of which most skip the fundamental understanding of computers and focus on getting simple and necessary things done. While there is inherently no problem with these courses, but how one consumes this information and often takes shortcuts to get things done faster. Learning to code is similar to learning a language. Can you imagine learning a language (say English or Hindi) in the way programming tutorials do? You are must fluent and comfortable in speaking your mother tongue, and you learned that making mistakes, discovered by some hand-holding, learned by understanding the alphabet, grammar, rules of the language but step by step, gradually. Do not learn in haste but learn on a daily basis. Unlike most people, I never worried about knowing the syntaxes or knowing how to compile a program. My point of concern was always the problem that I’m trying to solve through the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No matter how far down the wrong road you have gone, turn back now. - Anonymous Turkish Proverb&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much later, I learned C (the predecessor of C++) and could see how things were abstracted, made more accessible to the end programmer. And today we have way more simplified syntaxes to get things done. Can I at least ask members of DV to not fall into the trap, do not look for shortcuts. Find how the computer executes each instruction, and you will learn a great deal of information which is instrumental in this process of learning programming. After that, I tried with various languages and settled with C++. C++ is of course not the best language, but there is, in fact, no best language. Computer languages are generally developed to do a specific task, and C++ fits my need for scientific computing back in time. You would, of course, require HTML to code a web page, and C++ cannot get much over there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think just the documentation of a programming language you’re working with is enough for you to learn that language. You would find all syntaxes and constructs in it. And the rest will be simplified by me during the classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later I started solving problems (like PSETs) to get more and more comfortable with computers, and you would be amazed by how much you can get comfortable with speaking to computers! To me, it is like daily exercise one would do to keep their body fit. I have not stopped that even now, I do problems like these to get better and to be able to solve the more significant problems that I’m targeting at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, all of these are ups in my journey, where is the down? I have not had downs yet, but I’m ready to embrace it. Oh yes, just one that I can recall is that I was denied Computer Science during my eleventh standard admission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a small and abstracted and incomplete account of my journey with programming for you to have at least one takeaway but as I’m writing this sentence, I think this may encourage new-comers towards low-level programming. It’s okay if you don’t understand the difference between low-level and high-level yet. I will cover it in subsequent posts in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please do not solve PSETs by referring to examples on the internet; it will dilute your learning process. You are only allowed to see the programming language documentation. Python documentation in this case. And that’s’ all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-new&quot;&gt;What’s New?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Minor changes in look and feel of the website.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Minor bug fixes in the DV website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;and-so-far&quot;&gt;And so far…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most PSET problems solved (this week): None&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most PSET problems solved (all-time): Simran (38)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most rating (this week): Simran (22)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most rating (all-time): Simran (22)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Best streak: Simran (04/05/2018-08/05/2018 .. 5 days)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most PSET problems solved in one day: Simran (04/04/2018 .. 9 problems, 16/04/2018 .. 9 problems)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, who is finding difficulty to do PSETs and who is ready to take on the even more upcoming difficult challenge in DV?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You should figure out programs as you’re writing them, just as writers and painters and achitects do. Realizing this [programming as sketching] has real implications for software design. It means that a programming language should, above all, be malleable. A programming language is for thinking of programs, not for expressing programs you’ve already thought of. It should be a pencil, not pen. […] Remember too that languages are not primarily a form for finished programs, but something that programs have to be developed in. […] A good programming language should, like oil paint, make it easy to change your mind.[…] Paintings usually begin with a sketch. Gradually the details get filled in. But it is not merely a process of filling in. Sometimes the original plans turn out to be mistaken. Countless paintings, when you look at them in x-rays, turn out to have limbs that have been moved or facial features that have been readjusted.[…] So the test of a language is not simply how clean the finished program looks in it, but how clean the path to the finished program was […] What made oil paint so exciting, when it first became popular in the fifteenth century, was that you could make the finished work from the prototype. You could make a preliminary drawing if you wanted to, but you weren’t held to it; you could work out all the details, and even make major changes as you finished the painting. You can do this with software too. A prototype doesn’t have to be just a model; you can refine it into the finished product….it’s good for morale […] Building something by gradually refining a prototype is good for morale because it keeps you engaged. In software, my rule is: always have working code. If you’re writing something you’ll be able to test in an hour, you have the prospect of an immediate reward to motivate you. - P. Graham (in “Hackers and Painters” pg. 22, 27, 218, 219, 220, 221)&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/sub/weekly-update-30/">&lt;p&gt;Finally, I’m starting to see the sprouts above the ground. Thank you for reciprocating after last week’s update. I hope you soon see a positive impact of efforts that you’re taking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It’s not that I’m so smart, it’s just that I stay with problems longer.” - Albert Einstein&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it is difficult to keep up with DV on a daily basis, but that’s how it is. You have to put yourself in an uncomfortable position. And not putting enough efforts in DV daily will only make it harder for you and you will be helpless to complete the PSET problems in lesser time (and possibly adopt unfair means to do it). Be resilient and honest! All I want from you is to take genuine efforts on a regular basis to understand this lens of computation. As long as you continue to make efforts, you will keep solving the PSETs at the required pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can see that sometimes you feel that you should know more, especially about the programming language (Python in this case) itself to solve PSET problem. But sooner or later you will realize that learning to code mostly involves the right attitude and problem-solving capabilities and everything else is secondary. The syntax and constructs of the language will be given to you as you progress and are apt at your level. All I’m saying is that sometimes you make your job difficult by learning something before you should have. I intend (through PSETs) that you have enough practice to understand and familiarize before you acquire a shortcut to do that. For instance, there is a sort method available in Python to sort your list variable, but I have avoided so far so that you can learn how it works and code it by yourself. I hope you’ll appreciate the thought behind this later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;simran&quot;&gt;Simran&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You’re finally able to do DV daily. Continue with your efforts and focus on your streak.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Good work on updating your progress on the wiki.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Please add comments to your programs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use meaningful names for the variables and functions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add meaningful commit messages.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Avoid &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;global&lt;/code&gt;. Instead, read the variables from function argument and return the values to update those variables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;apoorva&quot;&gt;Apoorva&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Good work on sustained efforts minus wiki.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Please add comments to your programs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use meaningful names for the variables and functions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add meaningful commit messages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vineeta&quot;&gt;Vineeta&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You’re queuing at the exit door. Good luck!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pranjal&quot;&gt;Pranjal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Good work on sustained efforts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Please add comments to your programs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use meaningful names for the variables and functions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add meaningful commit messages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-new&quot;&gt;What’s New?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I have been experimenting with look and feel of the website. You will see new changes (work in progress) in this week’s update.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;and-so-far&quot;&gt;And so far…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most PSET problems solved (this week): Simran (6)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most PSET problems solved (all-time): Simran (38)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most rating (this week): Simran (20)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most rating (all-time): Unknown&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Best streak: Simran (04/05/2018-08/05/2018 .. 5 days)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most PSET problems solved in one day: Simran (04/04/2018 .. 9 problems, 16/04/2018 .. 9 problems)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;warning&quot;&gt;Warning!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One or more of you is/are found to be copying the code from the internet, and this is super serious! Your small violation might cost you exit from DV. Whoever you are (of course, I know who), please accept your offense it on #decodevector on the slack and don’t repeat this within DV again. You are enforcing me to make the rating system even more stringent for all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways that’s all for this week. Happy Monsoon and Happy (de)coding!&lt;/p&gt;

      <updated>2018-05-27T23:25:00+05:30</updated>

      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/sub/weekly-update-29/">&lt;p&gt;It is moments like these which make me question if I’m not doing enough to keep the energy alive. Repeating, it’s not going to come any easy. You’ll have to put in efforts, and only then you will reap its benefit. But, first, you have to start doing and do it daily. Well, the price you pay is a part of your time every day goes into this. And that will help you build the habit, habit of learning and practicing. Will you pay this price to reap the unknown? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week was no different from the past, same old story of scarce attempts and continuation of ignoring my requests. Everyone seems quite involved in their own business and have forgotten their word. It’s not going to work this way. Three of you are just about to slip, and I hope you are aware what will it take to start all over again (from the screening) post-summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why hurry up?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, there’s nothing wrong with self-paced. And speeding up without compromising on conceptual understanding is very difficult. The reason, why I emphasize on pace has a two-fold purpose - one that it will push you to take efforts on a daily basis which will help you make problem-solving as a habit and secondly because of the nature of technology itself. Theoretical CS and digital technology are advancing at an unprecedented rate, and as designers who have little to no formal background in fundamentals of CS, it’s very very difficult to be even get acquainted with tools and models, forget solving the problems through the lens of computation. There’s ML, AI, NLP, AGI, AR, VR and what not! But there is good news — that we have access to an abundance of resources - courses, book, tools on the internet that let you learn at your pace. But the catch is you will have to do it yourself; you will have to motivate yourself to get going and most likely if you’re not strong enough, you will lose the progress. All I can say now is that you can leverage from DV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;if-this-then-what&quot;&gt;If this then what?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appreciate yourself that you’re today able to code by yourself and you have achieved this in so less (D)ays. I’m sure you cannot imagine what you’ll be like if you do it regularly. I’m hopeful that one of you will soon reach level 1 and help express why daily efforts are non-negotiable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/week-29-chart.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure your pattern&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Writing this in big words, so you don’t miss this again. Please route your issues on GitHub whether you want to ask me or anyone else. Don’t use slack for clearing your code issues whatsoever. I have explained the reason in W27 update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-new&quot;&gt;What’s new?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New PSET problems added (0073-0082)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New website feature: &lt;a href=&quot;/search&quot;&gt;Search!&lt;/a&gt; You can now quickly search PSETs, notes or anything on the website through this&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Captions for each weekly update&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;and-so-far&quot;&gt;And so far…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most PSET problems solved (this week): Apoorva (unknown)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most PSET problems solved (all-time): Simran (29)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most rating (this week): Apoorva (unknown)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most rating (all-time): Apoorva (unknown)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Best streak: Simran (04/05/2018-08/05/2018 .. 5 days)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most PSET problems solved in one day: Simran (04/04/2018 .. 9 problems, 16/04/2018 .. 9 problems)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anyone who can make Apoorva mark her PSET progress correctly on her wiki will be rewarded.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Suppose that you want to teach the ‘cat’ concept to a very young child. Do you explain that a cat is a relatively small, primarily carnivorous mammal with retractable claws, a distinctive sonic output, etc.? I’ll bet not. You probably show the kid a lot of different cats, saying ‘kitty’ each time, until it gets the idea. To put it more generally, generalizations are best made by abstraction from experience.” — R. P. Boas (Can we make mathematics inteligible?, American Mathematical Monthly 88 (1981), pp. 727-731)&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/sub/weekly-update-28/">&lt;p&gt;The summer vacation is taking its impost. I know it is not easy to get going, but you are letting go of the time that would never return. All of you are very far from leveling up, and this is the time you can put hard work to lay a good foundation for your aspirations. Remember that the points you have accumulated are going in vain if you don’t work on a regular basis. Please please just get started, and you will realize that it was all that was required. You are not trying if have not yet begun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week has been rather silent. I have not seen or heard much. None of you have solved even a single PSET problem. And I don’t think I should tell its severity if you don’t realize that it was you who wanted to learn this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bad-things-will-happen&quot;&gt;Bad things will happen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite multiple requests, you are not addressing the GitHub issues. I’m thus closing all your previous issues (including peer reviews) without any resolution. And please keep all communication at one place (as I mentioned in last week update), it’s quite difficult otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nevertheless-some-suggestions&quot;&gt;Nevertheless, some suggestions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Important! Slow and steady wins the race. Keep moving daily. Don’t break your schedule.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep your programs/algorithms/solutions adequately organized in your computer and in GitHub to save time during future use.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adding problem/objective statement at the top of the program in comments can be useful during writing code and also for the future reference.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn to comment your code to keep your code understandable by not just you but others. Adding comments help avoid situations when you’re too busy writing code, and you feel distracted by smallest of the interruptions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Develop your approach to solve problems. Should you do a flow chart first? Alternatively, solve the test cases on the paper? Evolve a system of solving that works for you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Declare/Initialize variables before you use. In this way, you avoid errors related to un-declaration of variables.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Indent and format your code for readability.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use meaningful names for variables and functions or else forget reading your code in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Trace through your program to double check accuracy or fallacy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep a check on the different colors in your code editor that indicates what a pre-defined keyword, or which ones are variables or which one is a string, or anything else. Avoid common errors.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Avoid copy/paste.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not cheat yourself. Only you know if you understood the logic or not.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You are not your code. Criticism of your code isn’t a criticism of you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t go dark. Share your unfinished work with willingly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Test your work. Try writing tests before code.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be OK with you. You will never know everything - that is impossible. Keep learning, but don’t get caught up on what you don’t know.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Multi-tasking is an illusion (or maybe not). However, computers get away with it because they can context switch fast (most of the time). Do one thing at a time, and do it well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tell-me-something-good&quot;&gt;Tell me something good!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, there is some good news. Apoorva is gaining momentum in her project, and it is going well. Also, she has written an algorithm to list permutations of a given list for the Hamiltonian cycles, which is a brilliant attempt in itself and all of you should look how she developed it. Maybe Apoorva should tell us how she came up with this algorithm (and rating in her wiki).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-new&quot;&gt;What’s new?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DecodeVector repository is now licensed under MIT License. That means anyone else can use the source code of our website for their community freely. These are small ways through which we can return a favor to developer community who distributes a lot of free and open software like Atom, P5.JS, and Python, etc. Read our license &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mathscapes/DecodeVector/blob/master/LICENSE&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Code of Conduct is now integrated into our GitHub repo which will be shown to the members from time to time to ensure all of us are aware of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;and-so-far&quot;&gt;And so far…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most PSET problems solved (this week): None&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most PSET problems solved (all time): Simran (29)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most rating (this week): Apoorva (unknown)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most rating (all-time): Apoorva (unknown)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Best streak: Simran (04/05/2018-08/05/2018 .. 5 days)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most PSET problems solved in one day: Simran (04/04/2018 .. 9 problems, 16/04/2018 .. 9 problems)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <published>2018-05-13T17:15:00+05:30</published>
      <updated>2018-05-13T17:15:00+05:30</updated>
      <id>http://localhost:4000/sub/weekly-update-27</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/sub/weekly-update-27/">&lt;p&gt;Its been 27 weeks(!) since we started this group, which we call as DecodeVector now. Honest efforts have been taken by all of the members to not just keeping it alive but making it stronger, which is great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting from now, I will be writing weekly logs to summarise the progress we make as a group and glimpse of the coming weeks to plan better and updating ourselves to keep aligned to our long-term roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;keeping-our-communication-organized&quot;&gt;Keeping our communication organized&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is essential that we keep most (if not all) of our conversation related to DV at one place. We currently have GitHub Issues and #DecodeVector channel of HCD Slack workspace for communication, but it goes to Email/WhatsApp/Slack DMs which is not okay. The problem that I foresee is that we will be doing a lot of rework in future since we make a lot of one-on-one or closed group conversation which will eventually be required for others. I thus suggest if we try to keep our communication only over GitHub (for all important queries about PSET, review, website) and Slack for general correspondence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;peer-review-and-ghost-issues-in-github&quot;&gt;Peer review and ghost issues in GitHub&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you Vineeta and Simran for thoroughly doing the review for Apoorva. Peer review will be helpful for both learnings and be scrutinized for any wrong-doings(if there are any). The others have not been yet reviewed, and this needs to be done as early as possible. Please please mark your daily progress on your wiki not to accumulate pending. There will be more peer reviews in future, so be ready!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And leverage GitHub issues feature! Assign a right person who you want to ask, appropriate labels and title. And others are expected to keep a check on their email and GitHub notifications to track if they have any pending issues. Most of the times, someone’s issue just lie there not responded, and that’s not okay. Let’s all of us be accountable towards each other and respond to the issues were assigned to help each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;self-studying&quot;&gt;Self-studying&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m pleasantly surprised how you all are taking other courses or books to learn Python or other relevant subjects to gain more understanding. While it’s all good, only if you had paid more attention to the class, you would realize that you are already exposed to the information required to do PSETs. Nevertheless, I would encourage self-studying from other sources to gain more knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;delay-in-the-project-timelines&quot;&gt;Delay in the project timelines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The delay in your respective projects in unacceptable and since it was all voluntary, you are responsible for taking care of keeping up with the time. Please have a word with me, and let’s rethink your timelines to accomplish your goals within summer break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-new&quot;&gt;Whats new?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New PSET problems added (0062-0072).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed minor issues in PSET problems pointed out in GitHub issues.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New issue templates on GitHub issues (try creating a new issue to learn more!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;and-so-far&quot;&gt;And so far…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most PSET problems solved (this week): Pranjal (6)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most PSET problems solved (all time): Simran (29)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most rating (this week): Apoorva (unknown)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most rating (all time): Apoorva (unknown)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Best streak: Simran (04/05/2018-08/05/2018 .. 5 days)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most PSET problems solved in one day: Simran (04/04/2018 .. 9 problems, 16/04/2018 .. 9 problems)&lt;/li&gt;

      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/sub/pset-0071/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following problem is taken from Project Euler.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$F_n = F_{n−1} + F_{n−2}$, where $F_1 = 1$ and $F_2 = 1$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence the first $12$ terms will be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;F_1 = 1 \\
    F_2 = 1 \\
    F_3 = 2 \\
    F_4 = 3 \\
    F_5 = 5 \\
    F_6 = 8 \\
    F_7 = 13 \\
    F_8 = 21 \\
    F_9 = 34 \\
    F_{10} = 55 \\
    F_{11} = 89 \\
    F_{12} = 144 \\&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The $12$th term, $F_{12}$, is the first term to contain three digits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain $1000$ digits?&lt;/p&gt;</content>
