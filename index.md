### Have you ever wondered if there are patterns to how butterflies fly? Or How it could it possibly cause hurricanes?

DecodeVector is a cohort of curious minds that is mathematical and abstract in spirit, deriving its motivation from practical and everyday computation.
Our aim is to understand the nature of computation and, as a consequence of this understanding, design more efficient algorithms. We engage in mathematics, logic, science and other formal concepts as long as the motivation is clearly drawn from the field of computing.
